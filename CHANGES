---------------------------------- Version 1.1 ----------------------------------

This version fixes a few bugs and adds parametric bootstrap functionality for
gpd modelling.

Changes from version 1.0:

1. bootgpd and methods added.
2. gpd was not passing 'start' through to gpd.fit. Fixed.
3. Rationalized summary.gpd and its methods into a single script (no impact).
4. summary.gpd did the wrong simulation when covariates were in the model. Fixed.
5. Bug in qqgpd caused x and y values to be reversed. The y-axis is scaled to 
   accomodate the simulated envelope and this meant that outliers could be
   excluded from the plot. Fixed.
6. print.summary.predict.mex was showing too many decimal places. Fixed
7. validate.texmex failed on Windows due to / in file path (all tests still
   passed if executed individually). Fixed.

---------------------------------- Version 1.2 ------------------------------------
Changes from version 1.1:

1. rl.gpd had a bug in the way it computed standard errors. Fixed.
2. Original Heffernan-Tawn methodology used Gumbel marginal distributions.
   Keef-Tawn-Papastathopoulos modified this to Laplace margins and identified 
   constraints that keep the model physically plausible. The modified and
   constrained approach is implemented and is now the default.
3. Diagnostic plot of constrained Profile Log-likelihood surface added, to 
   help users check for convergence to mle on constrained parameter space.
4. New diagnostic plots for GPD models when there are covariates, as 
   part of the plot method for a gpd object.
5. A returned gpd object now has residuals attached.
