Extreme value modelling with R

Extreme value modelling using (so far) the Generalized Pareto distribution and generalized
extreme value distribution. The ability to add new distributions through new 'family' objects
is supported.

The conditional multivariate approach of Heffernan and Tawn (2004) is also implemented.

The development of texmex has been partially funded by AstraZeneca.
