The texmex package for R
========================

Extreme value modelling with R. Includes univariate
modelling using generalized Pareto distributions and
generalized extreme value distributions, and the
multivariate conditional approach of Heffernan and
Tawn.

The package contains a test suite that depends on the
testthat package. To use the test suite, install
using 'R CMD INSTALL --install-tests' and then running
'test_package("texmex")' within R.

This work was partially funded by AstraZeneca.
