\section{Introduction}
The texmex~\cite{texmex} package for R provides a suite of test routines
These tests include comparisons of
parameter estimates with published versions -- particulary values published in
works by Coles~\cite{coles} and Heffernan and Tawn~\cite{heffernanTawn} -- as well
as many comparisons with values produced by independently written code, and many
logical checks and checks for routine failure in the context of inappropriate
usage.

Many graphs are produced by the test suite and these can be visually compared
with published versions, or evaluated against known plausible output.

The testthat~\cite{testthat} package is used to provide the testing environment.

In total, over 1000 tests are performed providing a reasonable degree of
confidence that texmex produces the output expected of it.

\subsection{Software}
\Sexpr{version$version.string}~\cite{R} was used in the construction of this
vignette. Versions of texmex, sombrero, test that and other packages can be
found in the Appendix.

\subsection{Acknowledgements}
Some of the independently written code that is used for validation is borrowed
from the ismev~\cite{coles} and evd~\cite{evd} packages. Other code has been
provided by Yiannis Papastathopoulos~\cite{yiannis} and by Paul Metcalfe of
AstraZeneca.

The development of the the texmex package, including its test suite, was
partially funded by AstraZeneca.

\section{Using the validation suite}
To install the test suite, it is necessary to install the package with the option
{\tt --install-tests}. For example, if installing version 2.3 at the command
line from the package source (the .tar.gz file), the command would be

\begin{verbatim}
R CMD INSTALL --install-tests texmex_2.3.tar.gz
\end{verbatim}

The test suite depends upon the testthat~\cite{testthat} package, so it is
necessary to load that package before attempting to run any tests.

The test scripts are located under the package directory in {\tt tests/testthat}.
To run a specific test script, you can use

<<test_file, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE>>=
library(texmex)
library(testthat)
test_file("texmex/tests/testthat/test.revTransform.R")
@

for example. To run all test scripts (which will take a while), the command
is as follows, and the output consists of the majority of the remainder of this
document.

<<validate, echo=TRUE, fig.cap="Output from running the validation suite.">>=
test_package("texmex")
